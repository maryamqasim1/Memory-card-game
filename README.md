## Pseudocode
```
// The cards will be in random order every new game.
// The game will start when the user clicks start button.
// The cards will be displayed for few seconds then flip back.
// A timer will appear.
// The player should pick 3 matching cards.
// If the 3 cards don’t match it will flip back.
	// Else it will disappear.

// If the timer ends && player didn’t finish = lost.
// If all cards disappear && timer didn’t end = win.
